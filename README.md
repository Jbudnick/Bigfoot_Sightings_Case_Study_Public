# Data Import and EDA

As we filtered through the `bigfoot_first100records.json`



# Details of your text processing pipeline (cleaning, stop words, lemmatization, etc.)


# How/why you chose certain ML algorithms for analysis

# How you tuned and evaluated your model

# Results

Find something interesting in the data! That's not very specific, so here are some thoughts to get you going:

What state has the most UFO/bigfoot sightings? Can you visualize this/compare them?
What kind of language is used to describe UFO vs. bigfoot sightings. Does it vary by region or time?
A huge part of the challenge for this case study will be getting the data into a usable form, so don't fret about finding something mind-blowingly insightful in the data. Simply verifying a suspicion you have with a model or summarizing a quality about the data that is difficult to see in the raw data is good data science.
